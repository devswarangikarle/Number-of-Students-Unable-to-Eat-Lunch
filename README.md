# Number-of-Students-Unable-to-Eat-Lunch
The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbers 0 and 1 respectively. All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.  The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in a stack.
